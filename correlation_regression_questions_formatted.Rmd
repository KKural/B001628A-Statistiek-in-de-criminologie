# Correlation and Regression — Basics to Interpretation

Note: This file reformats selected questions from `Complete_Course_Questions.Rmd` to match the MCQ style used in `All quesion/basisbegrippen_statistiek.Rmd`. For purely visual items without a bundled figure, we provide conceptual phrasing; correctness may depend on the specific plot shown in class material.

### Question Q1 (Understand)
**Why is standardizing (using z‑scores) useful when comparing two variables?**

> **Hint:** Consider unit effects on covariance and correlation as a unit‑free measure.

1) The relationship fundamentally changes when time units change  
"1" = "❌ Incorrect. The underlying relationship doesn’t change due to units; only the magnitude of covariance does."
2) The relationship stays the same, but covariance isn’t comparable due to different units  
"2" = "✅ Correct! Correlation (r) is standardized and unit‑free, covariance is not. Standardizing enables fair comparison."
3) Covariance is always better than correlation  
"3" = "❌ Incorrect. Covariance depends on scale; correlation is scale‑invariant and often more comparable across contexts."
4) You should never standardize variables  
"4" = "❌ Incorrect. Standardizing is helpful to place variables on the same scale."

### Question Q2 (Remember)
**Where is the ‘center of gravity’ in a standardized (z‑score) scatterplot?**

> **Hint:** Z‑scores center variables around their means.

1) (0, 0) — the intersection of the means  
"1" = "✅ Correct! In z‑scores, the bivariate center is at (0,0): both variables have mean 0."
2) (1, 1) — one standard deviation point  
"2" = "❌ Incorrect. (1,1) is one SD above both means, not the center."
3) The densest part of the cloud  
"3" = "❌ Incorrect. The densest region (mode) isn’t necessarily the mean‑center at (0,0)."
4) The most frequent observed point  
"4" = "❌ Incorrect. That is the mode, not the mean‑based center in z‑space."

### Question Q3 (Understand)
**What is the main lesson of Anscombe’s Quartet?**

> **Hint:** Four datasets can have identical summaries yet very different shapes.

1) Correlation tells the whole story  
"1" = "❌ Incorrect. Identical correlations can arise from very different patterns."
2) Always plot your data first  
"2" = "✅ Correct! Visualization prevents being misled by summary statistics alone."
3) Graphs are less reliable than statistics  
"3" = "❌ Incorrect. Plots complement statistics; both are essential."
4) Linear relationships are the most common  
"4" = "❌ Incorrect. The quartet shows diverse structures with the same r."

### Question Q4 (Analyze)
**A headline reads: “Ice cream sales and drownings are strongly correlated.” What is a plausible explanation?**

> **Hint:** Think of a third variable (confounder) driving both.

1) Ice cream causes drownings  
"1" = "❌ Incorrect. Correlation does not imply causation."
2) Drownings cause higher ice cream sales  
"2" = "❌ Incorrect. Reverse causality isn’t plausible here."
3) Temperature/season increases both  
"3" = "✅ Correct! Warm weather raises ice cream sales and swimming activity, hence drowning risk."
4) There is no relationship at all  
"4" = "❌ Incorrect. There is an association, but not necessarily a causal one."

---

### Question Q5 (Apply)
**The relationship is curved but monotonically increasing. Which correlation should you choose?**

> **Hint:** Distinguish “linear” from “monotone”.

1) Pearson correlation  
"1" = "❌ Incorrect. Pearson measures linear association and may underestimate strength for curved patterns."
2) Spearman correlation  
"2" = "✅ Correct! Spearman uses ranks and captures monotone increasing relations better."
3) Both are equally appropriate  
"3" = "❌ Incorrect. Spearman is preferable here since it doesn’t assume linearity."
4) Neither  
"4" = "❌ Incorrect. Spearman is suitable for monotone but non‑linear associations."

---

### Question Q6 (Remember)
**You now measure X in centimeters instead of meters. What happens to r(X,Y)?**

> **Hint:** Correlation is scale‑invariant; covariance isn’t.

1) r becomes 100× larger  
"1" = "❌ Incorrect. Changing units doesn’t affect r."
2) r becomes 100× smaller  
"2" = "❌ Incorrect. Changing units doesn’t affect r."
3) r stays exactly the same  
"3" = "✅ Correct! r is unit‑free and invariant to linear rescaling."
4) r becomes negative  
"4" = "❌ Incorrect. The sign doesn’t change due to unit changes."

---

### Question Q7 (Understand)
**Why do z‑scores make axes more comparable in a scatterplot?**

> **Hint:** Consider “same scale” and “standard deviations”.

1) They put both variables in standard deviation units  
"1" = "✅ Correct! Standardizing puts both on the same scale, easing comparison and interpretation."
2) They always increase the correlation  
"2" = "❌ Incorrect. Standardizing doesn’t change r."
3) They remove all outliers  
"3" = "❌ Incorrect. Standardizing can help detect outliers but doesn’t remove them."
4) They make covariance unit‑free  
"4" = "❌ Incorrect. Correlation is unit‑free; covariance remains scale‑dependent."

---

### Question Q8 (Analyze)
**A scatterplot colors points by ‘neighborhood type’. How is the overall correlation r typically computed?**

> **Hint:** Compare subgroup calculations versus the full sample.

1) Using only the largest subgroup  
"1" = "❌ Incorrect. That ignores many observations."
2) As the average of subgroup correlations  
"2" = "❌ Incorrect. A simple average of subgroup r’s isn’t the standard approach."
3) Using all points together, ignoring colors  
"3" = "✅ Correct! By default r is computed on the full dataset regardless of color."
4) As a weighted average of subgroup r’s  
"4" = "❌ Incorrect. Not the default definition of r; the standard is one calculation on all points."
