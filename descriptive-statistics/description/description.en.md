# Understanding Statistics Types

What is the main purpose of descriptive statistics?

1. Predict future outcomes based on sample data
2. Summarize and describe the main features of collected data
3. Establish causal relationships between variables
4. Test hypotheses about population parameters

Write a function `answer()` that returns your choice as a number (1, 2, 3, or 4).

### Example

```python
>>> answer()
2  # Returning option 2 would be correct
