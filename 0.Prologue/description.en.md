# Preface
This course introduces bachelor-level criminology students to key statistical concepts through interactive exercises. It is designed to scaffold learning, gradually progressing from fundamental definitions to analytical reasoning and model evaluation. The exercises are based on real-world crime data and are structured to align with Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy and the principles of educational scaffolding.
