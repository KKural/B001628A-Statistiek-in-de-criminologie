# Introduction
Welcome to this interactive criminology statistics course. Each question provides a concept reminder (“Tip”) and gives feedback after your answer — not just whether it’s correct, but also why. You can retry questions and review feedback to reinforce learning.

Use the menu to navigate between series. Completion status is tracked so you can monitor your progress. Most exercises are multiple-choice, and require typing a number (1–4) as your answer.

Let’s get started!
